Secret IoT datahack projects__

Our team is completing two projects. __
The first is an SMS based systems that allows attendees to submit questions to event organizers and receive responses. The texts are ranked and displayed by importance and filtered for spam or offensive language. An included chatbot completes responses for frequently asked questions. __
The second involves the use of the LoPy to collect anonymous data. Software was designed to utilize the LoPyâ€™s ability to generate and communicate this data to a server over a long range. A model on the server side was then derived to illustrate usefulness of the dataset by detecting movement patterns.__
